## 🌟 Introduction

Water segmentation is an essential task in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster response. By incorporating **multispectral** bands (like **NIR**, **SWIR**) along with standard **optical RGB** data, this project enhances the detection of water bodies.

Multispectral imagery enables more accurate water body segmentation by capturing different spectral bands that are crucial for distinguishing water from land and vegetation.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a robust model for **water body segmentation** using both multispectral and optical data.
- Enhance segmentation performance with **Near-Infrared (NIR)** and **Shortwave Infrared (SWIR)** bands for better accuracy.
- Provide a reliable solution for applications like flood prediction, water resource management, and environmental conservation.

## 📡 Data Collection

This project uses satellite datasets that contain both **optical** (RGB) and **multispectral** data.

### Key Data Features:
- **Optical Data**: RGB (3-channel) images.
- **Multispectral Data**: NIR, SWIR, and other spectral bands.
- **Label Data**: Pixel-level annotations for water and non-water regions.

### Example Datasets:
- **Sentinel-2**: Available via [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).
- **Landsat**: Available via [USGS Earth Explorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/).

## 🏗 Model Architecture

The project uses the **U-Net** architecture, which is designed for image segmentation tasks. The model is trained to perform pixel-wise classification of water regions.

### Model Highlights:
- **Input**: Multispectral (e.g., NIR, SWIR) and optical (RGB) channels.
- **Architecture**: U-Net with skip connections for detailed segmentation.
- **Loss Function**: Binary Cross-Entropy or Dice Loss.
- **Post-processing**: Optional smoothing techniques like Conditional Random Fields (CRF).

## 💡 Applications

### 1. **Flood Monitoring** 🌊
The model can be used to detect and monitor flood-prone areas in near real-time. By segmenting water bodies, especially during extreme weather conditions, authorities can predict flood risks and take timely action.

### 2. **Water Resource Management** 💧
Track changes in water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs over time to assist in effective water management strategies, including monitoring water levels, planning irrigation systems, and managing drinking water supplies.

### 3. **Urban Planning** 🏙
Incorporating accurate maps of water bodies into urban planning helps in developing sustainable cities, ensuring the integration of natural water bodies into infrastructure planning, and preventing overdevelopment in flood-prone areas.

### 4. **Environmental Conservation** 🌍
This model can be used to map and monitor wetlands and other ecosystems closely tied to water bodies. Conservationists can track changes in water extent and quality, helping to protect critical habitats for wildlife.
