# Water-Segmentation-project
The Water Segmentation Project using multispectral and optical data leverages deep learning techniques to accurately detect and segment water bodies in satellite or aerial images. This approach incorporates both multispectral and optical data to enhance the model's ability to distinguish water from other land cover types.
